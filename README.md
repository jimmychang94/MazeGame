# MazeGame

A Simple maze project that I am working on  

## Technical Implementations

 * Unity
 * Visual Studio
 
 ### Other Considerations

 This application uses TextMesh Pro for the text written.  
 It would have included 150+ files to the project so it is added to the .gitignore file.  
 If texts don't work when this project is cloned, downloading and importing TextMesh Pro from the Unity Asset Store may be required.
